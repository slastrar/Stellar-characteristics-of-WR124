# Identification of a Wolf-Rayet Star in a Dense Stellar Region  

This university project focused on identifying a Wolf-Rayet star in a region of space densely populated with stars. Wolf-Rayet stars are rare, massive stars in the late stages of their evolution, characterized by strong stellar winds and the shedding of their outer layers.  

The process involved:  
- Extracting data from the **Gaia** astronomical database.  
- Applying astrophysical methods to isolate and identify the Wolf-Rayet star among the surrounding stars.  
- Calculating additional astrophysical parameters of the identified star to better understand its properties.
